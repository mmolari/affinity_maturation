# Affinity maturation simulation

This repository contains the code for the simulations and figures featured in the paper [*Quantitative modeling of the effect of antigen dosage on the distribution of B-cell affinities in maturating germinal centers*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55678), by Marco Molari, Klaus Eyer, Jean Baudry, Simona Cocco, and RÃ©mi Monasson, currently available on eLife.
Please don't forget to cite this paper if you use the code for your project.
For questions concerning the code please write to <marco.molari@phys.ens.fr>.

All of the code is written in Python3 (version 3.7.4).

Dependencies required to run the code include `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`. Moreover an installation of [jupyter](https://jupyter.org) is needed to run the `*.ipynb` notebooks.

## Repository structure:

- The folder `am_sim` contains the library with the definition of most of the core classes and functions.
- The folder `data` contains experimental affinity measurements for each immunization scheme. See [format of the data](#format-of-the-data) for more details.
- The folder `utilities` contains the definition of other functions used to create the figures of the paper.
- The `parallel_tempering.py` file contains the script used to perform the maximum-likelihood inference.
- The `inference_results` folder contains the results of the inference procedure. These results can be reproduced by running the `parallel_tempering.py` file, see [running the inference procedure](#running-the-inference-procedure).
- The `figure_*.ipynb` are interactive [jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks that contain code to create the figures of the main paper.
- The `figures` folder contains sub-folders, one for each figure, with the `.pdf` version of the figures. For simplicity we also include some pre-generated results of the stochastic simulations, but these results can also be recreated with the code included in the notebooks.
- The `docs` folder contains a short tutorial on how to use the code, see [a short tutorial](#how-to-implement-your-own-simulations-a-short-tutorial)

## Running the inference procedure

The results of our inference procedure, needed for the figures of the paper, is already present in the folder `inferece_results`. However one can reproduce these results by launching the python script `parallel_tempering.py`. This script will automatically create a new folder, named `reproduce_inference_results` in which the results will be saved. The new folder will contain the following files:

- `search_setup.txt` : a text file containing details on the initial setup of the search procedure, including a list of the initial model parameters value.
- `t_*_search_history.csv` : a pandas dictionary containing the results of the search up to time t. It is updated every 100 parallel tempering steps.
- `par_i.pkl` : a pickle file containing a dictionary with the initial values of all model parameters in the search, produced as a safety check.
- `dataset_list.pkl` : a pickle file containing the list of the datasets of which the likelihood is evaluated. These are all the datasets contained in the `data` folder, and this file is produced only as a safety check.

## Reproducing the figures of the paper

To produce the figures of the paper please run the corresponding `figure_*.ipynb` jupyter notebook. Some of the figures require running time-intensive stochastic simulations. In this case the user has the choice of skipping the notebook cell containing the simulations and load pre-generated results from the next cell.

For a quick preview of the figures and notebooks:

- [figure 3](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mmolari/affinity_maturation/blob/master/figure_3.ipynb)
- [figure 4](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mmolari/affinity_maturation/blob/master/figure_4.ipynb)
- [figure 5](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mmolari/affinity_maturation/blob/master/figure_5.ipynb)
- [figure 6](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mmolari/affinity_maturation/blob/master/figure_6.ipynb)

## Format of the data

The measurements are saved in `.csv` files, one per immunization scheme and condition considered. Each `.csv` file has a header containing details of the immunization scheme. This includes:
- `inj_dosage` : a list containing the amount of injected antigen in micrograms for each injection.
- `T_delay` : a list of time delays in days. These represent delays between injections, or delay between injection and measurement in the case of the last number.
- `meas_protocol` : wether the measurement is performed 1 day after boost or 4 days after injection.

The rest of the `.csv` file contains a table. Each column corresponds to a different mouse. Entries consist in single-cell affinity measurements. The measured quantity is the antibody dissociation constant Kd, measured in nano-Molar units. For details on the experimental technique used to obtain the measurements please refer to [*Eyer, Klaus, et al. "Single-cell deep phenotyping of IgG-secreting cells for high-resolution immune monitoring." Nature biotechnology 35.10 (2017): 977.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3964)

## How to implement your own simulations: a short tutorial

We include in the repository a small tutorial on how to implement custom-made immunization scheme simulations, and how to import new experimental datasets and run on them the inference procedure. This cna be accessed online at [ReadTheDocs](https://affinity-maturation.readthedocs.io/), or alternatively a local version can be generated by running `make html` from the `docs` directory.
